## Applying for a South African Visa

#### General information about South African Visas

Visitors’ visas are for international travellers (citizens of other countries) who have permanent residence outside South Africa and who wish to visit the country on a temporary basis for tourism or business purposes for a period of 90 days or less.

A visa simply indicates that your application has been reviewed at a South African embassy, mission or consulate and that the consular officer has determined you are eligible to enter the country for a specific purpose.

The visa will allow you to travel to a South African port of entry where an immigration official will then determine if you are allowed to enter South Africa and for how long you can stay for that particular visit. Visitors are restricted to the activity or reason for which their visas were issued.

On entry to South Africa, a visa is considered to be a visitor's permit. The permit’s period of validity is calculated from the date of entry into the country and will be set out under the heading "conditions" on the visa label. You must ensure that you apply for the correct visa/permit. Entry in the country may be refused if the purpose of visit was not correctly stated.

Requirements for visitor’s visas differ from country to country ( [**click here to see which countries are currently exempt**](/index.php/immigration-services/exempt-countries)), and the requirements are subject to change. As each application is treated as an individual case and you should make enquiries with your nearest South African mission or consulate abroad or any office of the Department of Home Affairs to see whether or not you are required to apply for a visa.

Remember that there is a fee charged for issuing a visa, and you should check the cost with the office as well as this is updated annually. The fee is payable in different currencies in different countries.

Visas are not issued at South African ports of entry, and airline officials are obliged to insist on visas before allowing passengers to board. If you arrive without a visa, immigration officials are obliged to put you onto a flight back to your home country.

Foreigners with long term status (work permits/permit residence) in the neighbouring countries who transit the Republic to return to their employment or residence are not subject to the transit visa, provided they are in possession of proof of their status.

## Critical Skills Visa

#### Introduction

The Critical Skills Work Visa will enable the Department and the government to achieve the objectives of programmes such as National Development Plan(NDP), Industrial Policy Action Plan(IPAP) and New Growth Plan(NGP). The Department of Home Affairs has amended the Immigration legislation that came with various changes, which led to the introduction of Critical Skills Work Visa (CSWV).

The Critical Skills Work Visa emanates from the merger of the former Exceptional Skills and Quota Work visas. The latter was issued in line with the Quota List of 2009, which had skills categories, requirements, and the quota of skills targeted in the Republic of South Africa. The Critical Skills work visa is issued in accordance with the [_**critical skills list**_](/images/PDFs/CritcalSkills_102023.pdf). The list was developed in conjunction with the ocupations in high demand and the scarce skills lists of the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET). The main objective of the critical skills work visa is to assist the government to realise the achievement of the National Infrastructure Project, the Strategic Infrastructure Projects and Key National Strategic Projects in support of the Department of Trade and Industry.

## Visas

### **General Information about Visas**

Applying for a South African Visa Visitors’ visas are for international travellers (citizens of other countries) who have permanent residence outside South Africa and who wish to visit the country on a temporary basis for tourism or business purposes for a period of 90 days or less.

A visa simply indicates that your application has been reviewed at a South African embassy, mission or consulate and that the consular officer has determined you are eligible to enter the country for a specific purpose.

The visa will allow you to travel to a South African port of entry where an immigration official will then determine if you are allowed to enter South Africa and for how long you can stay for that particular visit. Visitors are restricted to the activity or purpose for which their visas were issued.

On entry to South Africa, a visa is considered to be a visitor’s permit. The permit’s period of validity is calculated from the date of entry into the country and will be set out under the heading “conditions” on the visa label. You must ensure that you apply for the correct visa/permit. Entry in the country may be refused if the purpose of visit was not correctly stated.

Requirements for visitor’s visas differ from country to country [**(click here to see which countries are currently exempt)**](/index.php/countries-exempt-from-sa-visas "Countries exempt from South African Visas"), and the requirements are subject to change.

It is only after the Minister of Home Affairs has declared a prospective immigrant not to be a prohibited/undesirable person, that an application for permanent residency status can be submitted.

Once you have received a positive response from the Minister of Home Affairs, you may submit an application for either a Direct Residency Permit or a Residency-on-Other-Grounds Permit.

## Refugee Status & Asylum

**GENERAL PROCEDURE:  APPLICATION FOR ASYLUM**

[**Published Refugees ACT _<<<Click to download<<<_**](/images/REFUGEES_ACT_130_OF_1998.pdf)

**An Asylum Seeker**

He is a person who has fled his or her country of origin and is seeking recognition and protection as a refugee in the Republic of South Africa, and whose application is still under consideration.

In case of a negative decision on his application, he has to leave the country voluntarily or will be deported.

**A Refugee**

He is a person who has been granted asylum status and protection in terms of thesection 24 of Refugee Act No 130 of 1998.

Under the 1951 United Nations Convention, a refugee can be a “convention refugee” who has left his home country and has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or a membership in a particular social group.

Under the same convention, a refugee can also be a person “in need of protection”whose removal to his home country would subject him personally to a danger of torture or to a risk to his life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.

Role of the Government of the Republic of South Africa

The Government of the Republic of South Africa has an obligation to grant protection to refugees and other persons in need of protection under a number of UN Conventions such as the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.

However, Convention refugees and persons in need of protection based on a risk to life, or a cruel and unusual treatment must have faced personally the risk all the way throughin the country in question

**Eligibility Procedure: Asylum Seeker**

- A person enters the Republic of South Africa through a port of entry (a land border post, airport or harbor), claims to be an asylum seeker and is, therefore, issued with a section 23 Permits which is a non - renewable “asylum transit permit” of the Immigration Act.
- The permit is valid for a period of 14 days only and authorizes the person to report to the nearest Refugee Reception Office in order to apply for asylum in terms of section 21 of the Refugee Act.
- The asylum seeker is required to furnish:



A section 23 permit



Any proof of identification from the country of origin



A travel document if in possession of one

- The asylum seeker lodges in person his application at a designated Refugee Reception Office where an admissibility hearing takes place.The following are done:



Applicant’s fingerprints taken in the prescribed manner



Interpreter if secured (if necessary )



First interview conducted by a Refugee Reception Officer (RRO) and BI-1590 form duly completed



Applicant’s data and image captured in the refugee system



An Asylum Seeker’s permit (a section 22 permit) is printed, signed, stamped and issued to the Asylum Seeker

- The section 22 permit which is valid for a period of six monthslegalizes the asylum seeker stay in the Republic of South Africa temporarily pending a final decision on his application. The permit can be extended by an RRO for a further six months while the process of status determination is in progress.
- The holder of section 22 permit has the right to work and study in South Africa and is protected against deportation to his country of origin.

**Refugee Status Determination**

**Before the permit expires, the asylum seeker reports to the Refugee Reception Office for:**

- A second interview is conducted by a Refugee Status Determination Officer (RSDO)
- The RSDO proceed with a fair adjudication of the application, makes a decision on claims for asylum application and provides reasons for the decisions. The RSDO must on conclusion of the status determination hearing grant asylum; or reject the applicationas manifestly unfounded, abusive or fraudulent; or refer any question of law to the Standing Committee for Refugee Affairs (SCRA).
- When granted asylum (written recognition of refugee status), a refugee is generally issued with a section 24 permit, which allows such person to remain for a specified period of 2 years in South Africa, and it is renewable upon expiration of its validity after the review process by an RSDO. In this case, the refugee must write a letter requesting the extension of his or her refugee status
- He is also allowed to work and study in South Africa whilst the permit is valid.

**​**

**Refugee Enabling Documents**

- A refugee must apply for a refugee ID  at any Refugee Reception Office within 15 days in the prescribed manner.
- After being issued with an ID, a refugee can apply for a UNCTD (United Nations Convention Travel Document) at any Refugee Reception Office in the prescribed manner.
- An ID is free

**Appeal and Review Process**

- In case of rejection, an asylum seeker or refugee who believes that he has a well-founded fear of persecution but whose claim has been rejected, may decide to appeal against the rejection decision of the RSDO to the Refugee Appeal Board (RAB) in the prescribed manner within 30 days after the decision has been handed over to them.
- The Appeal Board conducts an appeal hearing during which the appellant who is entitled to a fair hearing have the rights to be heard and to present his case fully. The Refugee Appeal Board is responsible for considering and deciding appeals on decisions made by RSDOs.
- The RAB may after hearing an appeal confirm or set aside or substitute the decision of the RSDO.
- In respect of manifestly unfounded applications, the Standing Committee for Refugee Affairs (SCRA) reviews or confirms or sets aside decisions taken by the RSDO and refer cases back to RSDO for determination within 14 days as well as monitors in general the decisions of the RSDO.

**Certification**

- Submit a properly completed application for certification (BI 1754), which can be obtained from [EnquiriesSCRA@dha.gov.za](mailto:EnquiriesSCRA@dha.gov.za) or at the Refugee Reception Centre.

**CLARIFICATION OF QUESTIONS RAISED IN RELATION TO REPATRIATION DEPOSIT REFUNDS AT 28 FEBRUARY 2015**

**BACKGROUND**

In terms of [**_regulation 7(8) of the repealed Immigration Regulations, 2005_**](/files/Government_Notice_on_Repatriation_Refunds.pdf) (“Immigration Regulations, 2005”) made under the Immigration Act, 2002 (Act No. 13 of 2002) (“Immigration Act”) prior to its amendment by the Immigration Amendment Act, 20011 (Act No. 13 of 2011) prescribed, in accordance with section 10(5) of the immigration Act, the reasonable individual terms and conditions that may be attached to a temporary residence permit which amongst others related to payment of a deposit, which deposit shall be refunded to the depositor after the final departure of the applicant or after a permanent residence permit as contemplated in section 25 of the Immigration Act has been issued to the applicant.

In the light of the provisions of regulation 7(8)(d) of the Immigration Regulations, the Director-General invited any person who, prior to the coming into operation of the Immigration Amendment Act, 2011 on 26 May 2014, paid deposit as a guarantee of the return to his or her country origin, to approach, within a period **up to 28 February 2015**, anySouth African Mission in his or her country of origin for a refund of his or her deposit. The Department of Home Affairs’ Offices within the Republic may issue refunds only in exceptional circumstances where a person has acquired permanent residence permit.

Any person who claims a refund must produce the following documents:

- Completion of Form;
- Passport (not a copy);
- Original receipt of the deposit;
- Banking details / warrant vouchers (cheques);
- Reason why a client must be refunded;and
- Proof of final departure from the Republic of South Africa on or before the expiry of the temporary residence permit for which a condition of a deposit was attached, or proof of permanent residence permit.

**(NOTE: Anyone who had overstayed his or her permit shall not qualify for a refund).**

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**

Further to the issuance of Government Gazette No.38098 dated 13 October 2014 several questions relating to the refund process the following questions need to be addressed.

**_1. If a person entered on a Visitor’s Visa, received a study / work / own business permitfrom within South Africa and lodged the repatriation deposit when applying for the Study / Work / Own Business Permit, can you claim the repatriation deposit back now before 28th February 2015?_**

**Yes**

_**2\. If you paid a repatriation deposit when applying for your retired permit and are still on a retired permit without applying for change of status, will you lose your repatriation deposit if you do not claim your repatriation deposit back before 28th February 2015?**_

**No, the condition for your permit is still valid and effective until your permit expires of change status or granted permanent residence status.**

_**3\. If you lodged the repatriation deposit with your visitor’s visa application and changed to a study / work / own business permit within South Africa, can you claim the repatriation deposit back now before 28th February 2015?**_

**Yes**

**4\. If you have a repatriation deposit and have applied for change of status before 26th May 2014 and do not apply for the refund of the repatriation deposit before 28th February 2015, will you forfeit your repatriation deposit?**

**Yes**

5\. Can the deposit only be claimed from the country of origin at the South African Mission and not in the Republic of South Africa and failure to claim a refund by 28 February 2015 will result in the deposit forfeited to the State as unclaimed.

6.How is it feasible to ask immigrants to pay for a flight home to collect their deposit when that exercise may end up costing far more than the original deposit?

7\. If an immigrant does then decide to pay for the flight home to collect the repatriation deposit, how is it feasible for them to have to buy another flight back to their home country as proof of final departure? This means, in effect, that each immigrant collecting their deposits from their country of origin would have to pay for 2 return flights in order just to collect their repatriation refund. Was this the intention?

8\. What other options are there for immigrants to collect their refund, without having to go to their country of origin?

_**Response to question 5 to 8**_

**There is no requirement that people are to travel and claim refunds at home. (Provided the applicant meets the requirements set up in the directive)**

**9\. Are travellers with valid permits with expiry date beyond 28 February 2015 going to forfeit their deposits?**

**No, they will claim when their permits expiry or when they have changes status, or have been granted permanent residence status.**

**10\. The DHA has, inadvertently ( or deliberately?) put legal immigrants in a catch 22 situation where they lose if they do, and lose if they do not collect their deposits. It seems strange that immigrant students should lose substantial fees due to an amendment made after they already obtained their permits - Is this not a retraction of their original permits?**

**No student will forfeit his or her repatriation deposit if his or her permit is still valid and they will only claim when their permits expire at the end of their studies.**

_**11\. Can I be refunded if my status has changed from traveller/study /work permit to scarce skill permit and the new permit expiry is beyond the deadline?**_

**Yes**

=== Temporary Residency Visa.txt ===
General information about temporary residence visas
 

The Immigration Act, 2002 (Act No 13 of 2002), aims at setting in place a system of immigration control which ensures that visas are issued as expeditiously as possible, on the basis of simplified procedures and objective, predictable and reasonable requirements and criteria and without consuming excessive administrative capacity. The Immigration Act mandates the Department to promote economic growth through the employment of needed foreign labour, facilitate foreign investment, enable the entry of exceptionally skilled or qualified people, facilitate academic exchanges within the Southern African Development Community and promote tourism, without compromising the security of the Republic.

The Immigration Act provides for various categories of temporary residence visas, such as-

Transit visas for the purpose of transiting the Republic enroute to a neighbouring country
Visitor’s visas for visits not exceeding 90 days
Visitor’s visas for activities longer than 90 days but not exceeding three years
Study visas
Treaty visas
Business visas
Medical treatment visas
Relative’s visas
Work visas
Retired person visas
Exchange visas
 

The temporary residence visa application form, DHA-1738, contains a list of all the supporting documents which are required for the different categories of temporary residence visas. Applicants are advised to ensure that all the supporting documents are submitted with the application form, failure which may result in the application being refused.

With effect from 26 May 2014 applicants are required to submit an application for a temporary residence visa in person at the South African diplomatic representative in his or her country of origin or at a South African diplomatic representative in a neighbouring country if there is no South African diplomatic representation in the applicant's country of origin. The purpose of the in person application is for biometric data to be captured.

Applicants are advised to ensure that they apply for the correct temporary residence visa commensurate with the intended activities to be undertaken in the Republic, since holders of visitor’s visas are no longer allowed to apply for change of status or change of conditions relating to his or her visitor’s visa from inside the country. For example, a person who applies for a visa to visit a family member in South Africa cannot apply for a relative’s visa to remain in the country with such family member. Such person is required to return to his or her country of origin or of permanent residence in order to apply for a relative’s visa. The same applies to a person who obtained a visitor’s visa for short-term employment activities in terms of section 11(2) of the Immigration Act who cannot apply for a work visa from inside the country.

Applications may be made for the extension of a temporary residence visa by applying online, 60 days prior to the expiry date of the visa at www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica

## **General information about temporary residence visas**

_The objectives of the [**Immigration Act, 2002 (Act No 13 of 2002)**](http://www.gov.za/documents/immigration-act), which was implemented on 7 April 2003, include:_

- Facilitating and simplifying the issuance of temporary residence visas and permanent residence permits.
- Promoting economic growth by facilitating foreign investment and attracting exceptionally skilled and qualified foreigners to South Africa.
- Promoting tourism to South Africa.

#### **Documents required to apply for a long-term temporary residence visa, except medical treatment visa**

_The following general documentation must be submitted with all temporary residence visa applications on form **DHA-1738**, except in the event of an application for a medical treatment visa:_

- A passport valid for no less than 30 days after the expiry of intended visit
- A photocopy of all temporary residence visas endorsed in the passport
- Processing fee
- 1 recent passport size colour photograph
- A yellow fever vaccination certificate (if the applicant has travelled through or intends travelling through the yellow fever belt area)
- Police clearance certificates in respect all countries where the applicant has resided for a period of twelve months or longer since having attained the age of 18 years.
- Medical and radiology reports (radiology reports are not required for children under the age of 12 years and pregnant women)
- An unabridged birth certificate
- Proof of custody or adoption of a minor, where applicable
- Consent from the parents of a minor, where applicable
- A marriage certificate, where applicable
- Proof of a spousal relationship by means of an affidavit, where applicable
- A divorce decree or proof of legal separation, where applicable
- A death certificate in respect of a late spouse, where applicable

Supporting documents, in addition those mentioned above, are applicable to every category of temporary residence visa. These supporting documents are listed on the **DHA-1738** application form under each visa category.

#### **Where to apply for a temporary residence visa**

_Any foreigner who wants to enter South Africa must apply for the appropriate temporary residence visa at:_

- the South African diplomatic representative in his/her country of origin, or
- at a South African diplomatic representative in a neighbouring country if there is no South African diplomatic representation in the applicant's country of origin

Applications for temporary residence visas are processed and finalised at the foreign offices of the Department of Home Affairs. Arrangements to travel to South Africa must only be made once the temporary residence visa has been issued.

#### **Extending the validity of a temporary residence permit or applying for change of status or conditions**

An application for the extension of the validity of a temporary residence visa must be done at least 60 days prior to the expiry of the visa by submitting an application online at [**_www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica_**](http://www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica). There is a fee payable when applying for an extension of the validity of a temporary residence visa.

#### **Applying for a change of status or change of conditions relating to an existing temporary residence visa**

An application for a change of status or change of conditions relating to an existing temporary residence visa must be submitted online at [**www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica**](http://www.vfsglobal.com/dha/southafrica) within the validity period of the visa.

It is important to take note that the Immigration Act prohibits an application for change of status or change of conditions relating to an existing temporary residence visa, where the foreigner is the holder of a visitor’s visa or medical treatment visa. Such foreigners are required to return to their countries of origin or of permanent residence in order to submit an application for an appropriate temporary residence visa. Exceptions are only allowed where the foreigner is in need of lifesaving medical treatment, or where the foreigner is required to remain in the Republic in order to testify as a state witness in a criminal court case, or where the applicant is the spouse or dependent child of a work visa or business visa holder who wish to apply for a work visa or study visa.

#### **Business Visas**

Foreigners who are contemplating investing in the South African economy by establishing a business or by investing in an existing business in the country must apply for a business visa, if it is his or her intention to be employed in the business.

_The following documents must form part of a business visa application:_

- A certificate issued by a Chartered Accountant or a Professional Accountant registered with the South African Institute of Professional Accountants to the effect that you have at least _R5 000 000_ available in cash, or at least _R5 000 000_ in cash and capital to be invested in the Republic.
- A recommendation from the Department of Trade and Industry regarding the feasibility of the business and the contribution of the business to the national interest of the Republic.
- An undertaking that at least 60% of the total staff compliment to be employed in the operations of the business shall be South African citizens or permanent residents employed permanently in various positions.
- An undertaking to register with the-

1. South African Revenue Service;
2. Unemployment Insurance Fund;
3. Compensation Fund for Occupational Injuries and Diseases;
4. [_**Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission (CIPC)**_](http://www.cipc.co.za/); where legally required; and
5. Relevant professional body, board or council recognised by SAQA in terms of section 13(1)(i) of the [_**National Qualifications Framework Act**_](http://www.gov.za/documents/acts), where applicable.

The holder of a business visa is entitled to study part-time, without the need to apply for permission from the Department of Home Affairs in the form of an application for change of conditions to an existing business visa.

#### **General Work Visas**

General Work Visas are issued to foreigners where it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that South African citizens and permanent residents with the relevant qualifications or skills and experience are not available for appointment. Prior to submitting an application for a general work visa, the applicant’s prospective employer is required to apply to the Department of Labour for a certificate confirming that-

- despite diligent search, the prospective employer has been unable to find a suitable candidate with qualifications or skills and experience equivalent to those of the applicant;

#### **Critical Skills Work Visas [_(Click here for requirements)_](https://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/scarce-skills-work-quotas "Critical Skills Visa")**

From time to time the Minister of Home Affairs publishes a [**_Critical Skills list_**](http://www.dha.gov.za/images/immigration_critical_skills.pdf) in a Government Gazette. Prior to submitting an application for a Critical Skills Work Visa, the applicant is required to have his or her foreign qualification(s) translated by a sworn translator into one of the official languages of the Republic and to have such qualification(s) evaluated by the [_**South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA)**_.](https://dfqeas.saqa.co.za/dfqeas/user/home) The applicant is also required to obtain written confirmation(s) from a [_**professional body**_](https://www.dha.gov.za/files/Criticalskills/PB_list_with_websites_-_2015_03_12.xlsx), council or board recognised by SAQA or any relevant government department confirming the skills or qualifications of the applicant and appropriate post qualification experience. In the event that any law in South Africa requires of you to be professionally registered in order to practice your profession, your application must contain proof of an application made for a certificate of registration with the [_**professional body,**_](https://www.dha.gov.za/files/Criticalskills/PB_list_with_websites_-_2015_03_12.xlsx) council or board recognised by SAQA.

#### **Intra-company Transfer Work Visas**

Occasionally, multi-national companies may decide to transfer an existing employee in a key position from a foreign branch to a branch, subsidiary or an affiliate of that company in South Africa. These employees must apply for intra-company transfer work permits. In such cases, no proof of steps taken to obtain the services of a South African citizen or permanent residence will be required. However, it is required that the applicant must have been employed in the company abroad for at least six months prior to his or her transfer to the South African operations and the South African branch, subsidiary or affiliate company must provide a skills transfer plan as proof that the transfer of skills to a South African citizen or permanent resident will take place. Intra-company transfer work visas are issued for a maximum period of four years and are not renewable or extendable. Should the continued services of the applicant for some or other reason be required by the South African operations at the end of the four year term, an application for a new intra-company transfer work visa must be applied for from the applicant’s country of origin or of permanent residence.

The holder of a general-, critical skills- or intra-company transfer work visa is entitled to study part-time, without the need to apply for permission from the Department of Home Affairs in the form of an application for change of conditions to an existing work visa.

#### **Study Visas**

Study visas are only issued for studies at the following learning institutions-

- a school contemplated in section 1 of the [_**South African Schools Act, 1996 (Act No 84 of 1996**_)](http://www.gov.za/documents/acts); or

- an institution of higher education established in terms of the [_**Higher Education Act, 1997 (Act No 101 of 1997)**_](http://www.gov.za/documents/acts).

However, where a student is attending a school contemplated in section 1 of the South African Schools Act as the dependent child of a parent holding a visa issued in terms of section 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20 or 22 of the Immigration Act and is registered on the medical aid or international health insurance of such parent, proof of South African medical cover is not required.

#### **Exchange Visas**

Applications for exchange visas to take part in a programme administered or organised by a learning institution in South Africa in conjunction with a learning institution/organ of a foreign state, requires a confirmatory letter from the Department of Basic Education or the Department of Higher Education and Training, as the case may be, confirming that it is responsible for organising or administering the programme, outlining the activities and duration thereof, as well as confirming that it will take full responsibility for the student whilst he or she is in the country.

The financial assurance contemplated in section 18(1) of the Act shall be an amount, per person and per month, as determined from time to time by the Minister by notice in the Gazette, to be proven by means of a current salary advice or a certified bank statement not older than three months at the time of application: Provided that the financial assurance shall not be required where the South African citizen or permanent resident is a dependent child.

The current amount determined by Minister is R8 500.00

#### **Medical Treatment Visa**

Any foreigner who needs to undergo medical treatment in the Republic is required to apply for a medical treatment visa, which visa may be issued for periods of six months at a time. An application for a medical treatment visa must be accompanied by a letter from the applicant’s registered medical practitioner or medical institution within the Republic confirming that space is available at the medical institution; the estimated costs of the treatment; whether or not the disease or ailment is treatable or curable; the treatment schedule and the period of intended treatment in the Republic.
